               In the plot, we can clearly see "Titanic" was both a critical and commercial smash hit with nearly 2 billion USD global box office return. 
               <br>
               Thus, we will delve deeper into this movie.</p>

      <p>From the Word Cloud of 1997 Titanic Script, we can instantly spot three leading roles in the movie: "Jack", "Rose", "CAL(Caledon)".
         <br>
         Also, based on the second tier most frequent words such as "deck", "ship", "like", "water", "boat", we can easily get to know the theme of the movie.
         <br>
         If we hover over the words, in the floated tooltip, we can also see the frequency of the word.</p>

      <iframe src = "./map_1997.html" width = "823" height = "700" style="float:left" frameborder = "0">

      <iframe src = "./map_2012.html" width = "823" height = "700" style="float:right" frameborder = "0">

      <p>We know that "Titanic" was released originally in 1997 and again in 2012. Now, I plotted the global box office returns of both releases on 
         rotation globes .
         <br>
         <br>
         If we compare both plots, there are interesting facts beyond mere data.
         <br>
         <br>
         If we drag both globes to US, we can see that both bullet sizes of US box office have similar scales. This is because both data are adjusted 
         using the same logrithmatic function. 
         <br>
         <br>
         Now, if we rotate both globes to Russia, we can see that Russia has a much larger box office of the 2012 release than the 1997 release. 
         <br>
         One possible reason behind is that Russia may still be in the effect of post cold war era in 1997, and Russian audience might have 
         psychological repellence against US movie at that time.
         <br>
         <br>
         Now, if we rotate both globes to China, we can see that in 2012 "Titanic", the box office return in China have grown so much since 1997
         that it even supassed the US box office in 2012. 
         <br>
         This is a strong indication of the grown influence of Hollywood in China and its huge market for US movies.
