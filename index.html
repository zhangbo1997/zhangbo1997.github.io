    <p>From the line chart above, we can see that the sales of burger is relatively lower during weekends. McDonald is a fast food company. Thus, it
        is reasonable that our customer prefer to come during weekdays when they are too busy to squeeze time for dinner. During weekends, they would have
        many other alternatives for their leisure time.

    <h2>Overall Distribution of Burger Sales in Different Regions</h2>

        subtitle: {
            text: "Only 01/2016 data for generation this plot"
        },
        xAxis: {
            title: {
                text: "Locations"
            }
        },
        yAxis: {
            title: {
                text: "Burger Sales(USD)"

            }
        }
    });
    </script>
    <p>The bar plot displays the sales of each burger in all five different regions. Based on the information in the chart, all five regions have an almost equal
        distribution of all three kinds of burger. And the total sales of burger in all five regions are fairly equal. This phenomenon indicates that there is
        no huge differences between the popularity of each burger over all five regions. Thus, we are relaxed to deploy the same business strategy to all five
        regions.

    <p> From the "Overall Burger Sales Pattern", there is a clear drop of sales betweeen Sep. 2018 and Oct. 2018, which is exactly the month that "the Impossible
        Burger" was introduced. Thus the affect of "the Impossible Burger" on McDonald's businees is phenomenal. Some of our customers switch to Burger King for
        the "Impossible Burger". If we zoom in to "Sales Pattern of Each Burger" and "Sales Pattern in Each Region" and interact with the two tables, we can see that
         proportions of sales dropped are very even for each burger and in each region. Based on the insight above, the conclusion can be made that the attraction
          of “the Impossible Burger” to McDonald’s customers are insensitive to both burger kinds and regions. Thus, market vacancy for a Veggie burger 
          (“the Impossible Burger” is a Veggie burger) definitely exists and McDonald’s should take action in response to it. Since it is a kind of Veggie burger,
         McDonald's may also consider introducing a Veggie burger to compete against it. Also, as the effect of "the Impossible Burger" on McDonald's business
        are similar across the country, the introduction of McDonald's own Veggie burger should be deployed equally across the nation.
